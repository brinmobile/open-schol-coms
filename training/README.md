Schol Comm training
===============

As a newbie scholcomm librarian, I feel like I need training ASAP to:
* understand what everyone's talking about
* feel more confident speaking to faculty about matters that clearly relate directly to their work
* improve my techie skills
* better understand the options out there re: technology / architecture
* etc.

I'd be curious to hear what other folks are doing on this front, to hear reviews of any available training opportunities out there, and knowledge that others are looking to develop
