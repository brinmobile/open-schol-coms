Open Schol Coms
===============

OSC is a open, community-driven effort to share information and documentation related to Scholarly Communications within librarianship and beyond. Maybe you're not even sure what Scholarly Communications means? [ARL says](http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/scholarly-communication#.U85yFYBdX5Y) schol coms is, like:

> "the system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use. The system includes both formal means of communication, such as publication in peer-reviewed journals, and informal channels, such as electronic listservs."

Scholarly Communications is a *burgeoning* field in librarianship. As such, librarians far and wide are being asked to draft related materials for literacy and instruction. Mostly, this just ends up being basic description of the issues and links to other, more useful resources. Sometimes, it's new, rich documentation about a specific topic or subject.

### The Point

Open Schol Coms is intended to be a repository for sharing maintaining a broad range of documentation on Scholarly Communications. Topics of interest include:

- Open Access
- Repositories (Data or Research *or* Institutional **or** Community)
- Author's Rights
- And many moooooorrrreee...

Many of us are re-writing existing material already. Many of us are already borrowing. Let's just make our docs open with CC licenses and walk the OA walk, huh?

## Writing for OSC

All documentation written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), please. Make sure to save files with a .md extension. Additionally, if you could separate words in your file names with underscores or dashes and *avoid spaces*, that would be super cool.

Also, there's bound to be some national differences if this thing gets any traction. Funding agencies all over the globe are very different. Noting the country of origin (or, within, province or state or whatever) is likely a wise idea. I guess we'll figure that out as we go.  

## Are You New to Github But Want to Contribute?

Let's learn a thing or two about Git! That's sort of how this all got started in the first place, really. This repo is pretty simple. Github has a boatload of [guides](http://guides.github.com/) that are a great starting point. [Understanding the Github Workflow](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/) is particularly useful. You'll more or less be learning as I learn. Who doesn't love learning? Chumps, probably.

## Cough

OSC was started on a muggy summer day in Fredericton, New Brunswick by Scholarly Communications Librarian [Mike Nason](ahemnason.github.io) as he sat around thinking about how cool open access is (it's pretty cool).
